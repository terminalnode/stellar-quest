# Stellar Quest ðŸš€
These are my solutions to [Stellar Quest](https://quest.stellar.org/) problems. In short,  
Stellar Quest is a competition/game with problems to solve on the Stellar cryptocurrency 
platform. If problems are solved quickly enough, the solver gets a reward in XLM (Stellar Lumens,
the native currency of Stellar).

All quests take place on the Stellar TestNet so no real money are ever at risk (though rewards are
paid out on the MainNet and vary from 500 to 20 XLM). To be eligible for rewards one has to enter
the competition within an hour of it being announced.

Quests vary a lot in difficulty, for some quests you just need to send a payment to some address.
For some you need to make a series of transactions triggering the more sophisticated features of
the Stellar chain.

## Spoiler policy
I won't publish my solutions until at least 24 hours after registrations close, since that's the
cutoff for XLM rewards. That means this repository can't be used for free cash. :-)

## Missing solutions
This repository is an afterthought. As mentioned the quests vary a lot in difficulty, and many can
actually be solved on [Stellar Laboratory](https://laboratory.stellar.org/) without any code
whatsoever. In fact, all quests can probably be solved this way, but using the SDK is more
interesting to me.

I solved all quests in the first set using Stellar Laboratory before discovering the SDK, so those
solutions are currently missing. Once the TestNet resets (once every quarter) I may add solutions
to those as well.

## Why is this a Ktor project?
I mostly do backend web development, and I wanted to try out Ktor even if it doesn't make much
sense for this to be an API. It also provides an easy way for me to run specific solutions by
triggering their endpoints. Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯

## Bragging rights
These are my positions during the competitions I've participated in. Registrations open either 2 
AM or 2 PM where I live, and quests are released approximately 1.5 hours after that. So every 
other quest I will usually have to do them the day after if I'm to sleep before 4 AM. :-)
